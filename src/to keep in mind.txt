the global coordinates always follows the screen, which means, the top left of the screen is always 0,0 (origin point)
everything moves relative to this top left origin point
this logic means that the player's position will always be within the coordinates (0,0) and (screen_width, screen_height) 

to add:
1. come up with an interesting game mechanic idea and implement interesting
2. add more types of enemies
3. add co-op feature
